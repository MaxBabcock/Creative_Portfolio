This prompt, I focues on playing music corresponding to a certain image. This was achieved by taking an existing image, croppinf it so that
it was split in half,and triggering one half to appear when a key was pressed, and the other half to appear when the other key was pressed. I 
added a changing background depending on which half was selected, a restart button that paused the song and played it from the begining when it's 
key was pressed, and another button click which shows the full image
