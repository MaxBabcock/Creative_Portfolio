This prompt was probably one of my favorite ones to work on, as it was challenging to figure out but also fun to do once the code started to
click. The sketch takes inspiration from a program Tom wrote, which had a text broken down and then displayed scattered across the screen.
The initial idea was already fun, but I thought of a fun way to adapt it. I made the code so that depending on the area of the screen the 
user clicked with the mouse (dependant on the X position of the mosue at the time of the click), a different text would appear, describing
different characters simplified Bio's, two (Apin and Piesher) are original characters based off of the game Hollow knight, and the other
character (Sonis), is an original character based off of the Ori games. Using a similar code structure to Tom's, I go the text appearing
working. I had to add seperate run me variables so that only one text would appear when clicked(runme1,2 and 3). I took the idea further 
by also having it so that the backgroud would change colour that linked to the specific character, for some style points and to add some 
flair to it. After a bit of dificulty making those two elements work together, I did one final change, having it so that the letters moved 
randomly across the X axis while moving down uniformly on the Y axis, making it alot neater for viewers to read. 

I'd say this was one of the more challenging prompts I worked on, but fun regardless
