The basic idea for this is prompt a more developed version of the coin collection minigame given to us as a class, I found it quite fun, and so I decided 
to expand the idea out more. I used seperate variables so that the coin would teleport do a different place and stay stationary once there, becuase
if I just assigned the inital values to be random on the draw value, the coin was near impossible to click clearly, but moving it to the mosue 
pressed function fixed this issue. I made the 'hitbox' of the coin equeal to it's size (100 in this case), making the registering of actually
clicking on it consistent. I also added changes to the background, keeping it limited as to not see blinding colours in the background. I also
added a coin collection sound everytime the player succesfully clicked on a coin. I also added a timer, set to 60 seconds, and a socre, so that
players could try and collect as many coins as possible in the limited time. After those 60 seconds are over, I used an alert to stop the player,
and told them their high score, before giving instructions as to how to play again. Quick note that I decided to take assets from the mario series,
as that fit in well with the simple nature of the game, and helps incentivise the player to collect coins faster
