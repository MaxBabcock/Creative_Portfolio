This drawing prompt is trying to emulate the art piece 'Target' by Jasper Johns. The painting itself was relatively easy to replicate,
by using 3 circles with a blue outline and yellow fill, and adjusting the size accordingly so that it matched the source material. The
main problem came in the form in  trying to texture the drawing itslef, as creating individual shapes to create the illusion of texture 
was not exactly time efficient. I instead found a transparent png with some black splotches through a website (link below) and layered 
that over the drawing in order to make it look more realisitic. The picture could be changed out easily with other ones due to how simple
it is to add it to the code. 

Overall, a fun challange to do for the first prompt for the assesment
