This code was based off of the brush that Tom showed us in class, so I tried to make it so that it could be a continuous brush tool that you change
the size, stroke weight, and colour of as well. I made it so the colours and alpha (transparency) would change to a different value between 0 and 255
at random by pressing the r,g,b and a keys. The other two values use arrays in order ot have set changes. The number keys 1,2,3,4 and 5 all change
the size of the ellipse, while 6-0 are used to change the strokes weight. So thats how I developed the initial prompt into a more diverse brush
tool.
